  Much loved and well maintained by the same family for more than 40 years, this
  charming waterfront cottage on fully recreational Lake George now beckons new
  owners. Yes, it needs a little work, but the roof and some windows are recent,
  the view is spectacular, the lot is flat and faces west, and the character is
  abundant: knotty pine almost everywhere you look, a beautiful stone fireplace,
  and an attic easily converted to sleeping space for guests. Easy to show.
